Advanced phonebook exercise
===========================
This is based on the basic phonebook exercise.

Take the basic exercise and add io to the program and make the phonebook
persistant.

Each time the program starts to run look for a file called "phonebook.txt"
and load it into RAM if it exists.

Each time the program ends save the phonebook you have in RAM into the
phonebook.txt rewriting it in the process.

Make the format of the phonebook.txt file AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE.
A possible format can be:
=====phonebook.txt starts here=========
