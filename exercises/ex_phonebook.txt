- Write a phonebook application.
- The application should show the user a user interface along these lines:
1) Add a name/phone to the book.
2) Delete a name from the book.
3) Modify the phone for a name.
4) Show the entire phonebook.
5) Search for phone by name.
6) Exit.
- use procedures! (to show the menu, to do each item, ...)
- hold the phone book in an associative array in RAM.
