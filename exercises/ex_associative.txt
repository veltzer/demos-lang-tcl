- read a piece of text from the user (use [gets stdin])
- split that piece of text according to white space (even a single space is enough).
- count the number of times each word appears in the users text.
- print the count of each word that appeared in the text.

Example:
input text: to be or not to be that is the question
output:
to => 2
be => 2
or => 1
not => 1
that => 1
question => 1
is => 1
the => 1

- Create an associative array that stores countries as keys and their capital cities.
- now programmatically create the reverse of that associative array: map capital
	cities to the countries they are in.

Example:
Enter a city to find the country it is the capital of:
Jerusalem (<===user input)
Country is "Israel"
Washington (<===user input)
Country is "USA"
