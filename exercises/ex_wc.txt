wc -l exercise in tcl
=====================
Create a tcl script which calls another tcl script.
The parent tcl script will print mucho lines to the child script.
The child script will count the number of lines that it is supplied with.
When the parent sends the string "over" the child will write back
the number of line sent so far.
The parent will receive that number and will print it out.

Add a graphical user interface built upon tk for this. Integrate with your desktop (just kidding...)
