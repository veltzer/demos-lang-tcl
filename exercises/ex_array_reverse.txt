- Create an associative array that stores countries as keys and their capital cities.
- now programmatically create the reverse of that associative array: map capital
	cities to the countries they are in.

Example:
Enter a city to find the country it is the capital of:
Jerusalem (<===user input)
Country is "Israel"
Washington (<===user input)
Country is "USA"

Create an associate array. Make sure that this array has distinct values (as opposed
to distinct keys which all associative arrays have). Now reverse the array using code
and create another associative array which links values to keys (the "reverse" associative
array).

Demonstrate that it was done right in some way.
