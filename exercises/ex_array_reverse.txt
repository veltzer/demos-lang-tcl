- Create an associative array that stores countries as keys and their capital cities as values.
- now programmatically create the reverse of that associative array: map capital
	cities to the countries they are in.

* Note: there should be no problem with 'reversing' the array
since the names of the capital cities should be distinct.

Example:
Enter a city to find the country it is the capital of:
Jerusalem (<===user input)
Country is "Israel"
Washington (<===user input)
Country is "USA"
